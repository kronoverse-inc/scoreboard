# Scoreboard Sample
Create a sample scoreboard application to demonstrate proficiency in web development. Example scores and stats can be of any sport/game or other example scenario and can have any UI elements you desire. Data can be hard-coded, random, or externally sourced. Code is more important than appearance, but app should include examples both styling and scripting. Screenshots are included to illustrate an example scenario, but don't worry about trying to recreate them exactly. App should be a single-page web app with the following requirements:

## View - Scores
Load and display a list of scores of recent games. Example should illustrate scores updating and new games added periodically. Clicking on a game should bring you to Details view.
![scoreboard](./scores.png)

## View - Details
Load and show activity/details for one specific game.
![details](./details.png)

## IFrame Data Source
App should communicate with a page in a hidden iframe as the source of all data. Data source page should deliver results both in response to request from app, such as an initial load of scores/details, as well as providing unsolicited updates of new games and scores asynchronously.

## Delivery
Please submit code by pull-request in this repo.
